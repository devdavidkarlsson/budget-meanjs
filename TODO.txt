Create option for managing transfer between own accounts.


Add radiobutton/option for not recurring transfers.

Is summing for yearly and non-recurring working?










Done:

Show saldo on account list page.

Income/Expense remove not working, should rewrite getOne to similar to this:

    // Find existing Account
    $scope.findOne = function() {
      this.account = Accounts.get({
        accountId: $stateParams.accountId
      });
    };

    The $promise.then part breaks the resource, so that the remove function does not work anymore.
    Problem is, with the short getter above i do not get a date object and a boolean for date to the frontend.

    Solved by attaching account to this by passing that=this to the promise
