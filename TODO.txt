Create option for managing transfer between own accounts.



Create link to account that sends/receives.

Break out find by id service.




Make sure sending and receiving account cannot be the same.

Prevent editing of transfers in the income / expense listings.


Skip:
Add stock to any account (number of, purchase price, dividends)? fetch value-> profit/loss?



Done:

On incomes.query, get expense account if isTransfer. Or in the listing view add a link to the account/expense,


Tie resources to user

Add radiobutton/option for not recurring transfers.

Is summing for yearly and non-recurring working?

Show saldo on account list page.

Income/Expense remove not working, should rewrite getOne to similar to this:

    // Find existing Account
    $scope.findOne = function() {
      this.account = Accounts.get({
        accountId: $stateParams.accountId
      });
    };

    The $promise.then part breaks the resource, so that the remove function does not work anymore.
    Problem is, with the short getter above i do not get a date object and a boolean for date to the frontend.

    Solved by attaching account to this by passing that=this to the promise
